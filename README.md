# JavaScript_JSON_File_Iteration
Iterating through a JSON File. Implementation in JavaScript using JQuery and Ajax.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON stores data that is both machine and human readable. 
JSON does this by formatting data as array text files.
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of loading a JSON file into HTML DOM and iterating through its content.
The scripts make use of JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, HTML and JSON files.
The Script is written by Vakindu Philliam.
